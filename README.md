- 👋 Hi, I’m @FlowLucrezia - 👀 I’m interested in the dynamics of interpersonal communication (i.e, peer-peer, child-caregiver) over immediate and development timescales, embodied processes of emotional (dys)regulation, fundamental processes of motor control/learning and aesthetic experience in the context of artistic performance sports, yoga & meditation as potential rehabilitative modalities for chronic pain and anxiety disorders, and the development of holistic approaches to functional pre/rehabilitation for young athletes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work with Rstudio and Matlab for my ongoing + future research projects! To gain insights into the complex phenomena underlying the topics mentioned above, I want to apply various nonlinear analysis methods to a wide variety of physiological/psychological/behavioral measures.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future data analysis tools and projects :)
