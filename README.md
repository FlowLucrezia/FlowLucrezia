- 👋 Hi, I’m @FlowLucrezia - 👀 I’m interested in:
  - the dynamics of interpersonal communication (e.g., child-caregiver, teacher-pupil, peer-peer interactions) over immediate and development timescales;
  - embodied processes of emotional (dys)regulation, and how to socially scaffold resilient responses to environmental perturbations & traumas;
  - fundamental principles of motor control, learning, and subjective/aesthetic experience in artistic expression and sporting contexts;
  - yoga & meditation as potential rehabilitative modalities for chronic pain, addiction, and anxiety disorders;
  - the development of holistic approaches to functional pre-/re-habilitation for young athletes
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work with Rstudio and Matlab for my ongoing + future research projects! To gain insights into the complex phenomena underlying the topics mentioned above, I want to apply various nonlinear analysis methods to a wide variety of physiological/psychological/behavioral measures.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future data analysis tools and projects :)
