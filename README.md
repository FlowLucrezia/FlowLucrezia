- 👋 Hi, I’m @FlowLucrezia - 👀 I’m interested in the dynamics of interpersonal communication over the course of development (especially over transitions through early/late adolescence), embodied processes of emotional (dys)regulation across nested timescales, fundamental processes of motor control/learning and artistic experience within the domain of ballet (and other artistic performance sports), the potential of yoga & meditation as rehabilitative modalities for chronic pain and anxiety disorders, and the development of holistic approaches to functional PRE-habilitation for young athletes
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Rstudio and Matlab for my ongoing + future research projects! Using nonlinear statistical techniques including; (multi)fractal analysis, (C)RQA, MdRQA, cross-convergent mapping, etc...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future data analysis tools and projects :)
