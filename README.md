- 👋 Hi, I’m @FlowLucrezia
- 👀 I’m interested in interpersonal communication over the course of development (esp early/late adolescence), emotional (dys)regulation, yoga & meditation, individual and collective experience of dance and other aesthetically focused sports (i.e, gymnastics, figure-skating), and the development of holistic approaches to functional rehabilitation for young athletes
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Rstudio and Matlab to conduct my future research projects!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future data analysis tools and projects :)
- 📫 How to reach me: l.lucchi@student.rug.nl OR lucrezialucchi29@gmail.com
