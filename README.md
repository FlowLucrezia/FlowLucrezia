- 👋 Hi, I’m @FlowLucrezia - 👀 I’m interested in the dynamics of interpersonal communication (i.e, peer-peer, child-caregiver) over the course of development, embodied processes of emotional (dys)regulation across nested timescales, fundamental processes of motor control/learning and artistic experience within the domain of ballet (and other artistic performance sports), the potential of yoga & meditation as rehabilitative modalities for chronic pain and anxiety disorders, and the development of holistic approaches to functional PRE-habilitation for young athletes
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work with Rstudio and Matlab for my ongoing + future research projects! To gain insights into the complex phenomena underlying the topics mentioned above, I want to apply various nonlinear statistical techniques (DFA, MFDFA, RQA, CRQA, MdRQA, cross-convergent mapping, etc) to a wide variety of physiological/psychological/neuroscience measures (i.e, HR, skin conductance, marker-/video-based movement data, eye tracking, EMG, ECG, EEG, other neuroimaging methods, etc).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future data analysis tools and projects :)
